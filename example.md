## Original Paper: Impact of ML on Software Development

### Abstract
This paper examines the transformative impact of machine learning (ML) on modern software development practices. Through analysis of current industry practices and case studies, we explore how ML is changing traditional software development lifecycles, improving code quality, and enabling predictive maintenance.

### Methods
Mixed-methods approach:
- 100 development team surveys
- 20 case studies analysis
- Quantitative implementation analysis
- Expert interviews

### Findings
1. 75% reduction in bug detection time
2. 40% improvement in code review efficiency
3. 60% increase in sprint planning accuracy
4. Reduced deployment failures

### Discussion
ML shows significant positive impact on development efficiency, with challenges in implementation costs and expertise requirements.
